IngreView – AI-Native Ingredient Co-Pilot
IngreView is a prototype AI-native consumer health experience that helps users understand food ingredients at the moment decisions matter.

Problem
Food labels are optimized for regulation, not for people. Users are expected to interpret long ingredient lists, unfamiliar chemical names and conflicting health information, which creates uncertainty during decision-making.

Solution
IngreView acts as an intelligent AI co-pilot that reasons on behalf of the user. Instead of listing ingredients, the system explains:
- What matters
- Why it matters
- Where uncertainty exists

The AI is the interface itself, not an add-on feature.

Prototype
This is a front-end prototype built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to demonstrate the AI-native experience. Image and QR inputs are simulated to prioritize reasoning quality and experience design, as encouraged by the challenge scope.

Features
- Intent-first interaction
- No forms or filters
- Reasoning-driven explanations
- Honest communication of uncertainty

Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Demo
A 2-minute demo video demonstrates the user journey from uncertainty to AI-assisted understanding.
